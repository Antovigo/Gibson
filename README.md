This script allows to generate Gibson Assembly mixes for molecular 
cloning. Just type the requested parameters (separated with space or 
tab), and press enter to go to the following reagent.
When you're done, press enter once again and see the magic.

By default, the total volume of DNA is 10 μl, but you can specify something else as a command-line argument.

```
# If you want a total of 5 μl of DNA
./gibson.py 5
```
